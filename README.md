# Workout Tracker

A web application that allows a user to track his/her workouts with Moment. Has the option to add resistance or cardio workouts, as well as the weight, sets/reps, distance (for cardio), and duration of the workout. 

Utilizes a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express.
